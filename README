To run:

#Start the simulation, which then waits for darc to connect.
python gtcsim.py

#Now start darc
darccontrol configGTCAOSim.py

#Start a darcplot, and look at things...
darcplot

#There are some scripts that can be used:
#To turn off the atmosphere:
python setCalibrationMode.py 1

#And to turn it back on again:
python setCalibrationMode.py 0

#To set the WFS flux (to 100 photons/subap):
python setFlux.py 100


#To take reference centroids (do this in calibration mode, with high flux):
python takeRefCentroids.py

#To take a control matrix (again, calibration mode, high flux):
python doBasicPoke.py

#Set out of calibration mode...

#After doing this, you can close the loop (an optional gain parameter
#can be supplied, default is 0.5):
python closeLoop.py
(or, e.g. python closeLoop.py 0.1)

#To open the loop:
python openLoop.py





To view science PSFs, you can use the simulation tools:
simctrl.py

There is a button "connect" - enter "9000" in the box next to this,
and then click it.

Then click "Get plots".

Scroll down to the bottom and click the "Zero science"
button.  This resets the long exposure integration.

Scroll up slightly until you see "science_b".  Expand this item, and select
"Instantaneous Image".  Then you will see the AO corrected
instantaneous PSF, at 1650nm.  The "long PSF" item will show the
integrated PSF.  "Science params" item shows various parameters of the
integrated PSF (Strehl etc).

"science_buncorr" is the uncorrected PSF.

science_a and science_auncorr are PSFs at 700nm.

My quick tests give H-band Strehls of about 10%, though I've not done
any gain optimisation, or any investigations... it should be possible
to do a lot better.
